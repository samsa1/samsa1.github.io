I am a PhD student, working on Programming Languages. My current work is
related to the OCaml compiler and working towards
[modular implicits](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf).

# Software

## [OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml)

I've started working on the OCaml compiler in March 2024. Since then I worked on :


- [#13275](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13275) modular explicits (not merged yet)
- a few bug fix [#13053](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13053) and refactoring
PRs [#13113](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13113),
[#13681](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13681),
[#13682](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13682),
[#13683](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13683),
[#13684](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13684).

## [PureCake](https://github.com/CakeML/pure)

PureCake is a verified compiler for a Haskell-like language. My contribution to
this project was the formalisation and implementation of demands analysis.

For more details see the related section in
[PureCake: A Verified Compiler for a Lazy Functional Language](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3591259).

# Teaching

- I've did TD and TP for a course on the "fundamental principle of the binary machine" (binary arithmetic, boolean logic, boolean circuits and a bit of cryptography).
- I'm currently teaching TP in a Java course.
